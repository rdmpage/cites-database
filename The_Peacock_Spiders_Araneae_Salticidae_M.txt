Abstract

Six new species of the peacock spider genus Maratus Karsch, 1878 are described from Australia: M. eliasi sp. nov., M.
julianneae sp. nov., M. licunxini sp. nov., M. michaelorum sp. nov. and M. ottoi sp. nov. from Queensland, and M. ki-
wirrkurra sp. nov. from Western Australia. Five species groups are further documented within the genus and new records,
detailed SEM and automontage images are provided for six previously described species: M. anomalus Karsch, 1878, M.
chrysomelas (Simon, 1909), M. digitatus Otto & Hill, 2012, M. pavonis (Dunn, 1947), M. speciosus (O.P.-Cambridge,
1874) and M. volans (O.P.-Cambridge, 1874).

Key words: Australia, Bush Blitz, Carnarvon Station, Kiwirrkurra indigenous protected area, taxonomy

Introduction

The endemic Australian peacock spider genus Maratus contains 70 species (including these six new species).
Sixteen of these Maratus species need to be revised to resolve their correct generic placement (Otto & Hill 2016b).
Males of Maratus can be recognized by a dorsal abdominal plate with a dense cover of setae (Otto & Hill 2012a),
with small (sometimes minimal) or large side wings, which can be folded around the sides of the opisthosoma, and
by the behaviour of males of most species, which extend their third pair of legs and elevate their opisthosoma to
display to females (Otto & Hill 2012a). Outside Australia, only one Maratus species is known: M. furvus (Song &
Chai, 1992) recorded from the Wuling Mountains area in southwestern China. This Maratus species was originally
described in the genus Lycidas and may not be Maratus.

     This paper is dedicated to people who have documented Maratus in the last decade, utilising a diverse range of
skills and incredible patience watching and photographing courtship behaviour. It is through their work that the
world has come to learn of the amazing peacock spider fauna of Australia.

Material and methods

The spiders examined for this study included unidentified Maratus specimens from the collection of the
Queensland Museum. The study also included a new species from Western Australia. This will be lodged in the
Western Australian Museum, Perth (WAM). The remaining specimens will remain in the Queensland Museum’s
collection (QM).

     Three of the six new species were collected on Bush Blitz expeditions, firstly Carnarvon Station Queensland
(conducted by the Queensland Museum in October 2014) and subsequently Kiwirrkurra indigenous protected area
Western Australia (conducted by the Western Australian Museum in September 2015). Specimens of these new
Bush Blitz species were collected with pitfall traps, shallow plastic dishes with ethelyne glycol, and by hand.
Latitudes, longitudes and elevation were determined by GPS.

     Specimens were examined using a Leica MZ16A microscope. Images were produced using a Leica DFC 500

Taxonomy

Family SALTICIDAE Blackwall, 1841

Tribe EUOPHRYINI Simon, 1901

Genus Maratus Karsch, 1878

Maratus Karsch, 1878: 27. Type species designated by monotypy: Maratus amabilis Karsch, 1878, in Bonnet, 1957: 2713.

The endemic Australian Jumping spider genus Maratus belongs to the Saitis clade together with the salticid genera
Saitis, Jotus, Prostheclina, Hypoblemum, ‘Lycidas’, Maileus, Barraina and possibly Margaromma (Zhang &
Maddison, 2015). Zhang and Maddison (2015) suggested merging the genera of this clade into Saitis. To explore
this notion further it may be worthwhile to take a closer look into the ultrastructure of the embolic disc and the
embolus which appear to have a lot of hidden characters not visible with a normal microscope (Figs 1, 7, 11, 15);
however this paper does not aim to explore the monophyly of these genera, rather it is to describe a number of new
species of the endemic Australian Peacock spider genus Maratus found in the Queensland Museum Collection,
obtained on Bush Blitz expeditions and elsewhere.

     Diagnosis. Members of the genus Maratus share with other genera of the Saitis clade a relatively large male
palpal bulb with a retrolateral sperm duct loop (RSDL), a large retrobasal tegular lobe (TL), a finger-like
retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA), an anticlockwise coiled embolus (E) and a lamella on the tegular shoulder
(LTS) of the male palp (Zhang & Maddison, 2015).

     Maratus can be separated from other Saitis clade genera by males having an opisthosomal plate (often with
lateral wings, flaps or a wide lateral fringe) covered with a dense layer of colourful iridescent setae (Otto & Hill,
2012a), elevated to display to the female during courtship. Lateral ornamentation in the species here can be a
minimal edge (Figs 8E) as in M. anomalus, M. julianneae; a larger flap which nearly always remains folded around
the opisthosoma (Fig. 12B) as in M. eliasi; or a big flap running along the whole side of the opisthosoma (Fig.
16E), as in M. pavonis var. nornalup, M. volans and M. speciosus. Some Maratus species have inflatable spinnerets
which are used in the courtship dance [described in detail in Otto & Hill, 2012b] and shown here in (Figs 12A,
13A) in the cases of M. eliasi and M. ottoi.

The Maratus species groups

Species groups suggested by Waldock (2013) and Otto & Hill (2014b, 2015) take into account differentiation of
abdominal patterns and lateral ornamentation, inflatable spinnerets, and behaviour, especially male courtship.

     In this paper the male embolic discs of all examined species, studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
revealed microstructures of the embolic disc and the adjacent lateral process of the embolic disc, suggesting the
following species groups.

The Maratus chrysomelas group
(FIGURES 1A, B, D, E, G, H)

Otto & Hill (2016a) described the Maratus chrysomelas group (M. chrysomelas and M. nigromaculatus) as having
a wide fringe at the sides of the opisthosoma and similar courtship displays. We find also this group contains
species which have an embolic disc with a wide rim covered with frontal ridges and a flat retrolateral groove (Fig.
1G); the embolus opening is at the tip of the embolus (Figs 1D, E); and there is no lateral process of the embolic
disc (Fig. 1G).

     Species: Maratus chrysomelas from Western Australia to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland,
Maratus nigromaculatus (Keyserling, 1883) plus the new species Maratus kiwirrkurra from the Gibson Desert.

     Diagnosis. This small species belongs to the Maratus chrysomelas group, having a wide rimmed embolic disc
covered with frontal ridges. There is no retrolateral process of the embolic disc. M. kiwirrkurra can be separated
from other species of this group by the prosoma and opisthosoma being covered with cinnamon and white setae in
a mottled manner, an adaptation for crypsis in the sand of the Gibson Desert (Fig. 2C).

The Maratus fimbriatus group
(FIGURES 1C, F, I, 4A‒I, 5A‒F)

Otto & Hill (2016a) described Maratus fimbriatus after which this group is named. It contains species which have
a shiny black opisthosoma with two longitudinal stripes of white setae at the anterior edge and a long dense fringe
of white bluish iridescent setae along the sides, an embolic disc with a wide front, covered with frontal ridges and a
deep lateral groove like a wheel rim. There is no retrolateral process of embolic disc. The shiny black opisthosoma
and the enormous white bluish iridescent setae along the sides separate this group from any other Maratus group.

     Etymology. The specific name is a patronym in honour of Julianne Waldock, for her contributions to Maratus
systematics over more than two decades. She also provided excellent support for Madeline Girard in finding
Maratus localities.

     Diagnosis. This species belongs to the Maratus anomalus group, sharing a pair of large patches of white setae
on the posterior sides of the prosoma, with an embolic disc which has a smooth narrow front with a retrobasal
knee-shaped structure and a long narrow embolic tip with the embolic opening at the posterior distal part and a thin
semicircular lateral process of embolic disc with a narrow retrolateral fold.

     Maratus julianneae can be separated from M. michaelorum and M. anomalus by the pattern of the
opisothosoma. M. michaelorum has a pattern of a heart-shaped circle and two elongated patches of golden orange
setae in the centre and M. anomalus has a completely bluish iridescent opisthosoma, whereas Maratus julianneae
has a grey-whitish opisthosoma with bluish iridescent sides at the posterior third.

The Maratus digitatus group
(FIGURES 11A‒I, 12A‒I, 13A‒I)

This group contains species with small flaps, displaying with one leg to one side and with inflated spinnerets (J.
Otto, pers. comm.). They have an embolic disc with a broad smooth front and a broad spatulate embolic tip with the
embolic opening at the frontal distal part enclosed by a hole (Figs 11A‒F) and a finger-like lateral process of
embolic disc with pancake-stack shaped retrolateral ridges (Figs 11G‒I).

     The group includes Maratus digitatus from northern NSW and south eastern Queensland, plus the new species
Maratus eliasi from Queensland and Maratus ottoi from the Brisbane area.

     Further SEM examination of the embolic disc will clarify if the Maratus digitatus group is the same as the
Maratus calcitrans group (Otto & Hill, 2015).

     Etymology. The specific name is a patronym in honour of Dr Damian Elias, who helped to discover new
populations of M. eliasi while assisting his wife, Madeline Girard who was collecting specimens for her PhD work.

     Diagnosis. M. eliasi belongs to the digitatus group in having inflatable spinnerets (Fig. 12A) M. eliasi is
closely related to M. digitatus (mentioned in Otto & Hill, 2015: fig. 37 as Maratus cf. digitatus) sharing a nearly
identical prosomal colour pattern and in having a larger pair of semicircular, iridescent, flaps which are uniformly
dark green in M. digitatus.

     M. eliasi can be separated from M. digitatus by its opisthosomal colour pattern (golden and striped flaps) (Fig.
12A) and its shorter embolic tip (Figs 11B, E).

The Maratus pavonis group
(FIGURES 15C, F, I, 16A‒I)

This group contains those species with an embolic disc which has a broad smooth rim and a broad bent embolic
ridge with the embolic opening at the frontal end (Fig. 15F). The lateral process of the embolic disc has a pointed
tip and zig-zag longitudinal ridges (Fig. 15I).

     Further SEM examination of the embolic discs of known and other putative M. pavonis specimens will clarify
if the palpal characters shown in M. pavonis var nornalup are also present elsewhere in the Maratus pavonis
group.
