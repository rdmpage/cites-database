                        INTRODUCTION                                               
The operculate land snails of the superfamily Cyclophoroidea                       
are one of the more diverse terrestrial gastropods and show                        
a wide variety of lifestyles, ranging from ground dwelling                         
species that live hidden in the soil to tree climbing, arboreal                    
species that live in the canopy. It is a species-rich taxon                        
with turbinate to discoidal shells in which the last whorl is                      
sometimes disconnected (Kobelt, 1902; Wenz, 1938; Stanisic,                        
1998). In the Cyclophoroidea, the family Cyclophoridae Gray,                       
1847, is the largest taxon group containing about 35 nominal                       
genera (Wenz, 1938; Vaught, 1989). Their classiﬁcations
were established by Kobelt (1902, 1911) utilising shell                            
characteristics and have remained largely unchanged since                          
then. However, recent modern works on the diversity of                             
land snails in Southeast Asia using various systematic                             
characters, such as karyotypic and DNA sequence analyses,                          
have suggested that many cyclophoroidid species and taxa                           
at the generic level need to be largely revised (Vermeulen,                        
1999; Prasankok et al., 2009, 2011; Kongim et al., 2010,                           
2013; Marzuki & Clements, 2013; Nantarat et al., 2014).                            
This applied, for example, to the genus Pterocyclos Benson,                        
1832, where additional new materials are now available from                        
various localities in Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia for                         
a taxonomic study.

Pterocyclos has a wide distribution from South and Southeast
Asia to southern China (Kobelt, 1902, 1911; Gude, 1921;
Wenz, 1938; Yen, 1939; Benthem Jutting, 1948). The current
delimitation of species is still reliant on the classical works of
Kobelt (1902, 1911), which are mainly based on the degree
of the apertural lip expansion, the shape of the accessory
breathing structures, and other shell characters, including the
calcareous cup-shaped operculum. However, these characters
do not provide a consistent and unambiguous basis for the
separation of the currently recognised genera in the tribe
Pterocyclini.
Currently, the genus Pterocyclos is comprised of about 45
nominal species of which about 20 have been described
from South Asia and Burma, and about 10 from the Greater
Sunda Islands. Some are known from Indochina and southern
China. Only four nominal species are reported from Thailand
and Peninsular Malaysia (Kobelt, 1902, 1911; Gude, 1921;
Benthem Jutting, 1949; Hemmen & Hemmen, 2001; Maassen,
2001). This somewhat odd situation calls for a taxonomic
study of the species in these regions. However, in order to
do so it is necessary to investigate the type material of all
relevant Pterocyclos species in the ﬁrst step and to verify
their distinct generic placement. Against this background,
the present study aims to conduct a taxonomic study of
the Pterocyclos species found in Thailand and Peninsular
Malaysia, including a comparison of type material and
topotypic specimens. In addition, two overlooked species
from other genera are herein redescribed and assigned to
the genus Pterocyclos. Unique name-bearing types are also
designated to stabilise the names.

                MATERIAL AND METHODS                                       
Several areas were surveyed in eastern to southern Thailand
and in Peninsular Malaysia (Fig. 1). Specimens were                        
collected and processed for classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation.               
The terminology used in the description of their shell                     
characters, including the accessory respiratory structures                 
and the apertural lip expansion, follow Benthem Jutting                    
(1949), Cox (1964), and Rees (1964). The type specimens                    
and topotypic materials of all known nominal species that                  
have been included in the genus Pterocyclos were examined                  
and compared. The “shell” and “specimen in ethanol”                        
mentioned in the examined material refer to the empty shells               
and preserved specimens respectively. Descriptions of the                  
new species herein are attributed to the ﬁrst and the third                
author, Sutcharit and Panha, respectively.

                             RESULTS
This study recognised six nominal Pterocyclos species in
Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, two of which are new to
science. Four nominal species, Pterocyclos blandi Benson,
1851, P. regelspergeri Morgan, 1885, P. perrieri Morlet,
1889 and P. subalatus Sykes, 1903 have previously been
reported from Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia (Morgan,
1885; Morlet, 1889; Kobelt, 1902, 1911; Hemmen &
Hemmen, 2001; Maassen, 2001). However, after examining
the type material and topotypic specimens, only P. blandi
and P. subalatus were retained in the genus Pterocyclos. In
contrast, because “Pterocyclos” regelspergeri showed a deep
sutural groove, a calcareous plate-shaped operculum, and
a non-expanded apertural lip, this species was transferred
to the genus Pearsonia Kobelt, 1902. Similarly, topotypic
shells of “Pterocyclos” perrieri from Srakeo, Thailand, had
a corneous multi-spiral operculum, and an upper peripheral-
lip expansion near the suture, two characters typical of
the genus Ptychopoma Möllendorff, 1885, and to which
this species was hence assigned. In addition, two nominal
species previously classiﬁed as Rhiostoma spaleotes Tomlin,
1932, and Cyclotus umbraticus Benthem Jutting, 1949, were
transferred to the genus Pterocyclos.

Type species. Pterocyclos rupestris Benson, 1832 by
monotypy. The specimen that matches best with the original
description and ﬁgures (Benson, 1832: 13, pl. 2, ﬁg. 1A–C)
is here designated as the lectotype UMZC 2359.1 (Fig. 3A,
no operculum) to stabilise the name. The other specimens
become the paralectotypes UMZC 2359.2 (4 shells, Fig. 3B).
The type locality is from “outlying rocks of the Rajmahal
range of Hill, India”. Subsequently, based on differences in
the shell colour, Benson (1832: 13) also recognised three
varieties (var. 1–3) in the same lot of specimens. However,
only the syntype UMZC 2359.3 of “var. 3” (1 shell, Fig.
3C) could be distinguished from the others.
Diagnosis. Apertural lip narrow to wide, wing-shaped and
overhanging the accessory respiratory structure. This last

structure varies from notch-like to completely tubular in      
shape. The last whorl is usually completely attached to the    
penultimate whorl (only in a few species is the last whorl     
partly separated from the penultimate whorl). Operculum        
calcareous with a shallow to deep concave proﬁle, inside       
covered with a corneous layer, and outside with many           
calcareous counterclockwise multilamellae. These characters    
made Pterocyclos s.s. different from the other known           
pterocyclini genera.
External features. Animal shows blackish patches and/          
or mottles scattered on a whitish body, faded near mantle      
cavity (Fig. 2A–C). Head with pair of long cephalic tentacles  
(ct), each containing dark eyespot at outer base (Fig. 2A).    
Anterior body short with genital groove on right side running  
downwards from anterior end of pallial cavity. Posterior

Radula morphology. Typical taenioglossate radula were                       
observed (Fig. 2D, E), teeth arranged in v-shaped row,                      
each transverse row contained 7 teeth (2-1-1-1-2). Central                  
tooth large, symmetrical triangular shape, with 2–4 well                    
developed cusps on each side. Lateral and marginal teeth
slightly slender, inclining to central tooth, with 3–4 cusps.               
Shape of teeth and number of cusps vary among species.                      
Remarks. Two different spellings, viz. Pterocyclos and                      
Pterocyclus, are widely used in the literature and both                     
attributed to Benson (1832). However, the name Pterocyclus
is an unjustiﬁed emendation that has been erroneously used                  
as a valid name (e.g., Nevill, 1878; Fischer, 1885; Kobelt &
Möllendorff, 1897; Kobelt, 1902, 1911). Wenz (1938) was                     
the ﬁrst to place Pterocyclus in the synonymy of Pterocyclos.               
In addition, he attributed the authorship of Pterocyclus to
Crosse (1868). However, it now seems that Agassiz (1848:                    
908) was responsible for this unjustiﬁed emendation. Hence,                 
the proper authorship and date of the name Pterocyclus is                   
“Agassiz, 1848” (ICZN, 1999: Art. 50.5).                                    
Nomenclaturally, Pterocyclus Agassiz, 1848 [Mollusca,                       
Gastropoda] is a junior homonym of Pterocyclus Gray,                        
1846 [Aves, Passeriformes, Tomaliidae]. Thus, it should not                 
be used as valid generic name (ICZN, 1999, Arts. 23, 52),
even if Pterocyclus Gray, 1846 is itself a junior subjective                
synonym of Garrulax Lesson, 1831 (Deignan et al., 1964;                     
Sibley & Monroe, 1999).

Remark. Pterocyclos blandi was described by Benson                          
(1851) in one of the two papers (out of nearly 60) in which                 
Benson dealt with land snails and provided illustrations                    
of specimens (Naggs, 1997). The species identiﬁcation is
unambiguous and there are no type specimens. The species                    
differs from all other Pterocyclos species by its depressed                 
and thick shell, and transparent periostracum. The shell                    
colour is usually uniform brown to purplish, rarely with                    
variegated brown zigzag pattern, apertural lip whitish; upper               
part of the apertural lip broadly expanded and wing-shaped;                 
lower part of the apertural lip thickened and not expanded.                 
Accessory respiratory structure triangular, overhanging by                  
                                                                       333
the upper part of the apertural lip. Operculum calcareous,
slightly concave inside, and multilamellae outside.
The species was not found in the limestone areas of Perlis,
Kedah, Perak and Kelantan in Malaysia, and in southern
Thailand. This suggests that P. blandi has a limited
distribution and is possibly endemic to Langkawi Islands,
Perlis, Malaysia, where the species seems to be declining
due to exploitation of the limestone quarries.

    Type locality: Gunong Inas, at 5000 feet.
Pterocyclus subalatus—Laidlaw, 1928: 30. Maassen, 2001: 27.
Type specimens. Holotype UMZC 1032 (height 8.8 ×
diameter 17.2 mm, Fig. 3G) (no other material was available).
Remark. Pterocyclos subalatus has been described in detail,
based on two shells (Sykes, 1903). Because of its relatively
small size (diameter about 15 mm), and its thick and brownish
periostracum, this species superﬁcially resembles the genus
Cyclotus. However, the holotype clearly shows the typical
characters of Pterocyclos, i.e., the expanded apertural lip, with
thin channel and shortly expanded of apertural lip at suture
area, operculum low cup shape, and multilamellae outside.
This species clearly differs from P. spaleotes and P.
umbraticus because its last whorl is not disconnected from the
penultimate whorl, while its accessory respiratory structure
has a shallow channel. It further differs from P. umbraticus

Type specimens. The specimen herein designated as the lectotype
NMW 1955.158.01107 (height 11.4 × diameter 22.8 mm; Fig. 3H, no
operculum), to stabilise the name, is the shell ﬁgured in the original
description (Tomlin, 1932, pl. 26 text ﬁgure). The other specimen
from the same lot of the lectotype becomes the paralectotype NMW
1981.118.02705 (1 shell, Fig. 3I, no operculum).

Remark. Pterocyclos spaleotes is only known from its type
locality, despite several surveys in nearby areas. Originally, it
was described from two shells without an operculum, which
leads Tomlin (1932) to assign it to the genus Rhiostoma
Benson, 1860. However, after examining the types (Fig.
3G, H) and topotypic specimens (Fig. 3I), this generic
placement seems untenable. The unique characters of P.
spaleotes are: the small and thin shell, the corneous and
transparent periostracum, and the surface with a variegated

Etymology. The speciﬁc epithet is from the Latin word                
“diluvium” meaning “inundation or flood”. This is a
commemorative name referring to the most devastating                 
ﬂooding in the history of the Kingdom of Thailand in the             
year 2011.                                                           
Diagnosis. This new species differs from P. blandi by having         
a larger shell, a triangular shaped accessory respiratory            
device, an upper apertural-lip that is only slightly expanded,
and a white to brown shell colour. It differs from the other         
newly described species, viz. P. frednaggsi Sutcharit &              
Panha, new species, by having a white to brown shell, a              
thin periostracum, a triangular shaped accessory respiratory
device, and a narrow peripheral band. The differences from           
Rhiostoma asiphon Möllendorff, 1893, are the white to                
brownish shell colour, the low, cup-shaped operculum, and            
the triangular accessory respiratory structure.                      
Description. Shell medium to large, depressed, thickened,
and widely umbilicated. Apex acute; spire nearly ﬂat; suture         
wide; whorl 4–5 convex becoming increasingly regular. Shell          
surface with thin growth lines; periostracum thin, corneous          
to brownish colour. Last whorl rounded and stout, narrow             
dark brown peripheral band usually present. Shell colour             
monochrome white, brown or brown zigzag pattern. Aperture            
rounded with white lip; upper peripheral-lip is slightly             
expanded near suture. Apertural tube structure triangular            
shaped, connected with a radial ridge parallel to apertural          
lip margin. Operculum calcareous, slightly concave inside            
and multilamellae outside.

Distribution. Pterocyclos diluvium Sutcharit & Panha, new
species, has only been located in limestone areas. It is mainly
distributed in southern Thailand in Trang, Patthalung, Satun,
Krabi, and Songkhla Provinces. In Malaysia, it was recorded
from limestone hills in Perlis and Kedah.
Remarks. This new species is superﬁcially similar to R.
asiphon with which it could easily be misidentiﬁed. Under the
name “Rhiostoma asiphon”, not in the sense of Möllendorff
(1893, 1894), several specimens were reported from many
localities from Peninsular Malaysia (Benthem Jutting, 1960).
We examined those specimens and revisited all mentioned
localities, and conﬁrmed none of them could be identiﬁed
as R. asiphon s.s. Moreover, the type specimens of R.
asiphon (lectotype SMF 130509 and paralectotypes SMF
130510, 130511, 130512) are clearly distinct from this new
species. Especially, with the purplish to black shell colour,
the calcareous cup-shaped operculum, and notch shaped
apertural tube structure.
Intraspeciﬁc variation was observed in the specimens from
Tam Tone-din, Satun (CUMZ 4590). This population tended
to show a wide range of shell colour variation from dark
brown (Fig. 3P) to white (Fig. 3O). However, the unique
accessory respiratory structure and the operculum suggest that
the observed colour variation is likely to reﬂect intraspeciﬁc
patterns, although this requires further corroboration, such
as from molecular data, for conﬁrmation.
Pterocyclos frednaggsi Sutcharit & Panha, new species
              (Figs. 1, 2A–C, E, 3Q–S; Table 1)
Type specimens. Holotype CUMZ 4594 (height 12.1
× diameter 27.8 mm; Fig. 3Q). Type locality: Bukit
Chintamanis, Pahang, Malaysia (03°26.798' N, 102°00.987'
E). Paratypes CUMZ 4581 (18 specimens in ethanol, Fig.
3R), 4571 (29 shells), NHMUK (2 shells), NMW (2 shells),
SMF (2 shells) are from the type locality.
Other material examined. Gua Pulai, Gua Musang, Kelanta,
Malaysia CUMZ 4597 (9 shells, Fig. 3S), 4944 (4 specimens
in ethanol).
Etymology. The specific epithet “frednaggsi” comes
from Fred Naggs, malacologist at the Natural History
Museum, London, who has enthusiastically encouraged and
continuously supported land snail research in Thailand and
other Southeast Asian countries.
Diagnosis. Pterocyclos frednaggsi Sutcharit & Panha,
new species, differs from P. blandi by having a thick and
yellowish periostracum, a broad, dark brown peripheral
band, a channel shaped accessory respiratory structure, and
a slight expansion of the upper part of the apertural lip. It
differs from P. spaleotes by having a larger shell, a thicker
periostracum, and a broad, dark brown peripheral band.
The differences from P. diluvium Sutcharit & Panha, new
species, include the broad, dark brown peripheral band and
the channel shaped accessory respiratory structure.

This new species is superﬁcially similar to P. umbraticus, but        
differs from this latter species by its relatively smooth shell       
surface, the broad dark brown peripheral band, and the fact           
that its distribution is limited to the lowland limestone area        
(altitude less than 200 m amsl). In contrast, P. umbraticus           
has a chevron-shaped, zigzag shell sculpture and tends to             
live in non-limestone forests of highland areas (altitude
about 200–1600 m amsl) at Maxwell’s Hill and Gunung                   
Brinchang, Pahang (Benthem Jutting, 1949).
Description. Shell medium sized, depressed, thickened,                
widely umbilicated. Apex acute; spire ﬂattened to slightly            
elevated; suture wide; 4–5 convex and regularly increasing            
whorls. Shell surface with thin growth lines; periostracum
brown and corneous. Last whorl rounded, stout, with a                 
broad dark brown peripheral band. Shell colour brownish               
or with a variegated, dark brown zigzag pattern on early              
whorl. Aperture rounded. Apertural lip white, upper part              
slightly expanded near suture. Accessory respiratory structure
channel-like to short tubular shaped. Operculum calcareous,           
slightly concave inside, and multilamellae outside.                   
Radula. Central tooth with well developed central cusp and            
two smaller lateral cusps on each side; central cusp small
with pointed tip; four smaller lateral cusps on both sides            
with dull to pointed head. Lateral teeth have three cusps;            
outer cusp large, elongate shape, and two smaller inner               
lateral cusps with curved tips. Inner marginal teeth have
three cusps; central cusp large and convex head, and ﬂanked           
with smaller and pointed head of one inner and one outer              
lateral cusps. Outer marginal cusp bicuspid, each cusp with           
pointed head (Fig. 2E).
Distribution. This limestone dwelling species is known from           
the type locality and from Gua Musang, Kelantan, Malaysia.            
Remarks. Specimens of this species from Gua Musang,                   
Kelantan (Fig. 3S) have slightly larger and darker shells with        
a narrower peripheral band than typical shells. However,              
the unique shape of the short tubular accessory respiratory
structure and the multilamellae operculum suggest that these          
atypical forms represent intraspeciﬁc geographic variation.
