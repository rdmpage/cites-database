        The land snail genus Pterocyclos Benson, 1832 (Caenogastropoda:
        Cyclophoridae) from Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, with
        descriptions of two new species

             Abstract. Specimens of the operculated land snail genus Pterocyclos Benson, 1832, from Thailand and Peninsular
             Malaysia were investigated based on their shell characteristics. Type specimens and topotypic material were studied
             and compared with newly collected specimens. Two new species are described, viz. Pterocyclos diluvium Sutcharit
             & Panha, new species, from Tam Sumano, Patthalung, Thailand, adjacent areas in Thailand, and Malaysia, and
             Pterocyclos frednaggsi Sutcharit & Panha, new species, collected from Bukit Chintamani, Pahang, Malaysia, and
             adjacent areas in Peninsular Malaysia. Two species that hitherto were included in Pterocyclos, viz. P. blandi Benson,
             1851 and P. subulatus Sykes, 1903, were retained in this genus, while two other former Pterocyclos species were
             re-assigned to other genera, viz. Pearsonia regelspergeri (Morgan, 1885) and Ptychopoma perrieri (Morlet, 1889).
             Conversely, two previously described species in other genera (Rhiostoma spaleotes Tomlin, 1932, and Cyclotus
             umbraticus Benthem Jutting, 1949) are here transferred to Pterocyclos, viz. P. spaleotes (Tomlin, 1932) and P.
             umbraticus (Benthem Jutting, 1949). To stabilise the nomenclatural status, the lectotype of Pterocyclos rupestris
             Benson, 1832, and Pterocyclos spaleotes are designated herein.
